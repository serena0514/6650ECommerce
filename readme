There are two spring boot apps
One is a coordinator. Other is the e-commerce server. All instances of server register with the coordinator on startup. Coordinator implements Consensus and Paxos by
communicating with the server.
How to run:
1) Run using IntelliJ 
2) Run coordinator first by running the main function in CoordinatorApplication.java (No arguments)
3) Next, run multiple instances of demo application which are basically spring boot servers of the application (at least 5) by running DemoApplication.java (No arguments)
4) Clients can use the following APIs:

a) List of all products: localhost:1010/product - GET
b) List of all orders: localhost:1010/order - GET
c) Specific order: localhost:1010/order/{orderId} - GET
d) Create new order: localhost:1010/order - POST
   Payload example: 
{
  "productOrders": [
    {
      "product": {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "T-shirt",
        "price": 42
      },
      "quantity": 5
    },
    {
      "product": {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Pants",
        "price": 23.99
      },
      "quantity": 5
    }
  ]
}
